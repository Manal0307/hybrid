PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS DOCUMENT (PRD)
Project: Hybrid Programmable Bag
1. Product Overview
1.1 Product Name

Hybrid Programmable Bag

1.2 Product Type

Interactive fashion-tech prototype (physical + digital hybrid system)

1.3 Product Vision

Hybrid Programmable Bag is a 3D-printed sculptural object that merges physical form with programmable digital identity.

The project explores how a physical object can become dynamically customizable through artificial intelligence and real-time web-based interaction.

The bag becomes:

A programmable surface
A hybrid design object
A digitally-extended physical artifact

2. Product Goals
2.1 Primary Goals

Transform a static physical object into a programmable system

Enable real-time interaction between web interface and hardware

Integrate AI-generated visuals into tangible materiality

Create a fully functional prototype

2.2 Success Criteria

The project is successful when:

AI-generated textures can be created via prompt input

Generated images appear on the bag’s screen

LED lighting can be adjusted in real time

Servo motors can be triggered via the website

Communication between website and bag is stable and responsive (<2 seconds latency)

3. Target Audience

Design students

Digital artists

Creative technologists

AI enthusiasts

Interactive media creators

This is an experimental prototype — not a commercial mass-market product.

4. Product Scope
Included

3D design and 3D printing of the bag

Integration of Raspberry Pi, HDMI screen, LED strip, and servo motors

Development of immersive web interface

AI image generation

Real-time hardware communication

Excluded

Mass production

Industrial waterproofing

Autonomous AI behavior

Advanced robotics

Mobile application

Cloud-scale infrastructure

5. Physical Structure
5.1 Design

Designed in Blender.

Requirements:

Organic, sculptural form

Flowing geometry

Structural perforations

Internal compartments for electronics

Ventilation openings

Integrated HDMI screen frame

Hidden cable routing

Separate strap component

The bag is intentionally designed as a design object, not a conventional backpack.

5.2 Production

Material:

PLA or PETG

Constraints:

Structural stability

Modular internal access

Safe cable management

Secure screen positioning

6. Hardware Requirements
6.1 Raspberry Pi (Model 4 Recommended)

Acts as central controller.

Responsibilities:

Receives HTTP or WebSocket requests

Displays image via HDMI

Controls GPIO for LED and servos

6.2 HDMI Display

Integrated into front panel

Minimum resolution: 800x480

Connected via HDMI

Displays AI-generated textures.

6.3 LED Strip

RGB (WS2812B recommended)

Controlled via GPIO

Provides internal illumination

6.4 Servo Motors

1–2 micro servo motors

Subtle, controlled movement

Used to animate decorative elements (e.g. flowers)

Movement must remain safe and minimal.

7. Web Experience & Creative Direction
7.1 Core Philosophy

The website is not a traditional UI.

It is an immersive WebGL environment.

It should feel like entering a digital gallery or interactive sculpture space — inspired by experimental studios such as Rocani and Viva La Labia.

The website is:

A digital extension of the physical object.

7.2 Frontend Technology Stack

React (Vite)

Three.js

WebGL

GSAP (optional, for advanced animation)

Custom shaders (optional)

Post-processing effects (optional)

The primary foundation is:

React + Three.js + WebGL

GSAP may be used for:

Camera transitions

Micro-interactions

Scroll animations

UI transitions

Motion choreography

7.3 Immersive Scene Concept

Instead of a standard webpage, users enter a 3D environment.

The scene includes:

3D model of the bag

Cinematic lighting

Subtle camera motion

Atmospheric background

Mouse-responsive interaction

Soft shadows and depth

7.4 Interaction Design

The interface elements should feel integrated into the 3D world.

Possible design directions:

Floating prompt input

Animated “Generate” interaction

Interactive color orb for LED control

Clickable hotspot to activate servo

Transition effect when sending image to bag

UI should feel sculptural and spatial, not flat.

7.5 Visual Tone

The website must feel:

Futuristic

Artistic

Experimental

High-end

Minimal but expressive

Not commercial or product-focused

Important aesthetic elements:

Depth through lighting

Ambient shadows

Subtle noise

Reflective materials

Organic motion

8. Functional Requirements
8.1 AI Image Generation Flow

User Flow:

User writes a prompt (e.g., “Metallic organic texture in blue and silver”)

Clicks “Generate”

Frontend sends prompt to backend

Backend calls OpenAI Image Generation API

Image is returned

Image is previewed in the browser

8.2 Send to Bag Flow

User clicks “Send to Bag”

Frontend sends image (base64 or URL) to Node.js backend

Backend forwards image to Raspberry Pi

Raspberry Pi renders image on HDMI screen

Must occur in real time.

8.3 LED Control

User can:

Select RGB color

Optionally adjust brightness

Flow:

Frontend → Backend → Raspberry Pi → GPIO → LED strip

8.4 Servo Activation

User clicks activation control.

Flow:

Frontend → Backend → Raspberry Pi → GPIO → Servo movement

Movement sequence is predefined and limited.

9. Backend Requirements
Technology

Node.js

Express

REST API

Optional WebSocket for real-time communication

Local network communication

API Endpoints
POST /generate-image
{
  "prompt": "metallic organic texture blue and silver"

}
POST /set-led
{
  "r": 255,
  "g": 0,

15. Final Summary

Hybrid Programmable Bag is a sculptural 3D-printed object with embedded digital technology.

Through an immersive WebGL website, users generate AI-driven textures and send them to the bag in real time. LED lighting and subtle mechanical motion extend the object’s dynamic identity.

The project investigates how physical form can become programmable, responsive, and digitally extended.
